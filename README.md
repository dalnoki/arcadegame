===============================

You only need to click on index.html and you're ready to roll!

The goal of the game is to get to the water with the little guy, by using the up-down-left-right buttons.

If the player character collides with the enemy the game resets and you need to start it over!

Good luck, if it's too hard, just refresh the page - enemy speed is generated randomly so you might be lucky next time with slower bugs ;)

You can try the game [here](https://dalnoki.github.io/arcadegame/)!
